## Conclusion

> स्वस्थस्य स्वास्थ्य रक्षणं, आतुरस्य विकार प्रशमनम् ।  
> ज्ञानं च रोगाणाम् च दैवं च जीवितम् च ॥  

Preservation of one's own health is a duty. Ill health is a sign that we have violated the laws of nature and that we need to correct our course. Knowledge about diseases, their causes and their cures, as well as the role of fate and the importance of living a good life, are all important for good health.

> आरोग्यम् परमं भाग्यम्, स्वस्थस्य स्वास्थ्य रक्षणं ।  
> वैद्य नारायण हरेः प्रसाद, रोगादि दोषान् प्रशमयति ॥  

Good health is the ultimate blessing, and it is the duty of each individual to preserve their own health. By the grace of Lord Narayana, the physician can cure diseases and alleviate their causes.
